# Development process

We use Gulp tasks to lint, test and build this project. Please check

how to use them. You don't need to know Gulp to use these tasks.

# Requirements

Our coding style is documented
[here](https://github.com/ehmicky/eslint-config#coding-style). Linting and
formatting should automatically handle it though.

After submitting the pull request, please make sure the Continuous Integration
checks are passing.

We enforce 100% test coverage: each line of code must be tested.

New options, methods, properties, configuration and behavior must be documented
in all of these:

- the `README.md`
- the `docs` directory (if any)

Please use the same style as the rest of the documentation and examples.
